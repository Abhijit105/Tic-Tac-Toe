# Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic-Tac-Toe project is undertaken by me on 30th August, 2023. It is my first project in Javascript. I completed it on 5th September, 2023.

This is a game in which there are two players; one with a 'X' and other with a 'O'. The players have to make a combination of 3 'X' or 'O' either in a row or in a column or a diagonally. The first player to do so is declared the winner. If no player is able to make such a combination and they finish marking all the 9 boxes, the game is deemed a draw.
